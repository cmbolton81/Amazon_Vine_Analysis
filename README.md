## Summary 
After looking at the data it does not look like there is bais in the Vine program. When you look at the data it looks like they actual only give 5 stars on 42% of the compared to the non-Vine at 47%. The big thing to keep in mind here is that there is alot more non-Vine reviews than there are Vine. To take this a step further i would want to look at the number of non-Vine reviews where from the people that actual used it. We could do more filtering by the verified purchase.
